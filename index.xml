      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;reflections-on-steinitz-in-the-wp-league&#34;&gt;Reflections on Steinitz in the WP League&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I look back at the 2019 Western Province League, I feel immense pride in what Steinitz Chess Club has achieved. Over the course of that season, we played &lt;strong&gt;11 matches&lt;/strong&gt;, winning &lt;strong&gt;10&lt;/strong&gt; and drawing just one — against a strong MRL side. Not once did we taste defeat. That kind of consistency doesn’t happen by accident. It reflects years of teamwork, preparation, and commitment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
